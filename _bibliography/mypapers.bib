  abstract={Research on the dissociation between nouns and verbs has been seeking explanations from the perspectives of morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties of nouns and verbs at the lexical level. However, sub-lexical processing seems to be left out in the discussion. Having the information of grammatical class of morpheme, Chinese disyllabic compounds are ideal materials to investigate the effects of sub-lexical properties on the dissociation between nouns and verbs. The present study investigated the effects of noun neighbor ratio of the first character (NNR1) on grammatical class recognition of disyllabic compound nouns in Chinese. Noun neighbor ratio (NNR) is defined as the ratio of the number of noun neighbors (NN) to the neighborhood size (NS) at the same position (e.g., NNR1=NN1/NS1). The experiment matched seventeen nuisance variables between two conditions: low NNR1 and high NNR1. Participants were asked to judge the grammatical class of the target word as quickly as possible. Results showed that words with high NNR1 were processed more quickly than words with low NNR1. The facilitative NNR1 effect suggests that grammatical categories and semantic information of sub-lexical morphemes and disyllabic neighbors are activated during word processing. The results support the semantic explanation of the dissociation between nouns and verbs and call for more attention to NNR in further research on the noun/verb dissociation.}
