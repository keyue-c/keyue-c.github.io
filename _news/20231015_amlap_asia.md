I'll attend [AMLaP Asia 2023](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/amlap.asia/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong on December 1-3, to present my study "<a href="/assets/pdf/conference/conference_AMLaPAsia2023_rapid_abstract.pdf">Rapid semantic updating despite prediction errors: eye-tracking evidence from Mandarin Chinese</a>". Looking forward to meeting you there!
