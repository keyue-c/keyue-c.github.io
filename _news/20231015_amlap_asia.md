I'll attend [AMLaP Asia 2023](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/amlap.asia/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong on December 1-3, to present my study "Rapid semantic updating despite prediction errors: eye-tracking evidence from Mandarin Chinese" ([slides](https://keyue-c.github.io/assets/pdf/conference/conference_AMLaPAsia2023_rapid_slides.pdf)). Looking forward to meeting you there!
