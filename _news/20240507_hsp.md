I'll present two posters remotely at [HSP 2024](https://hsp2024.github.io/program.html). [The first EEG study](https://keyue-c.github.io/assets/pdf/conference/conference_HSP2024_incremental_abstract.pdf) looked at how people use consecutive cues to update their predictions for upcoming nouns while reading sentences. [The second study](https://keyue-c.github.io/assets/pdf/conference/conference_HSP2024_coregister_abstract.pdf) with [Yiling](https://yiling-huo.github.io/) co-registered mouse cursor and eye movements and compared their sensitivity.
