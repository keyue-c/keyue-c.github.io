I'm excited to see you at [AMLaP 2024](https://amlap2024.ed.ac.uk/) in Edinburgh! I'll be kicking things off with the first 15-minute talk, titled "Comprehenders use consecutive cues to update prediction incrementally: Evidence from eye-tracking and ERPs" ([abstract](https://keyue-c.github.io/assets/pdf/conference/conference_AMLaP2024_comprehenders_abstract.pdf)). Additionally, I'll be presenting two posters â€” one used pupillometry and the other explored co-registered mouse cursor and eye tracking data.
