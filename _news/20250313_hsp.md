I'll be presenting two posters at [HSP 2025](https://hsp2025.github.io/) on the mechanisms of prediction revision: one using [visual-world eye-tracking](https://keyue-c.github.io/assets/pdf/conference/conference_HSP2025_updating_abstract.pdf) and the other using [ERP](https://keyue-c.github.io/assets/pdf/conference/conference_HSP2025_dissociating_abstract.pdf). I'll be in **Session 2 (Friday, 10 AM)**. See you there!
