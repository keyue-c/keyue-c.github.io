Hello! My name is Kayla, or Keyue Chen (陈珂月). I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Psychology at South China Normal University. I am also a member of the [Reading and Development in Children and Adolescents Laboratory](http://read.scnu.edu.cn/), where I work primarily with [Prof. Suiping Wang](https://psy.scnu.edu.cn/a/20150624/18.html). I completed my PhD in the Department of Linguistics, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London. During my time there, I worked with [Dr. Wing-Yee Chow](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucjtwyc/Home.html) and [Dr. Andrea Santi](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/34103-andrea-santi/about), focusing on psycholinguistics and sentence processing.

My current research investigates (1) how comprehenders generate and update real-time predictions about upcoming language, and (2) the potential cognitive costs associated with violated predictions. To address these questions, I have employed a range of methods, including reaction time measurements, eye tracking, mouse tracking, pupillometry, and event-related potentials.

You can find my [publications](https://keyue-c.github.io/publications/), [conference presentations](https://keyue-c.github.io/conference/), [teaching](https://keyue-c.github.io/teaching/), and [CV](https://keyue-c.github.io/cv/) here. I also share my recent publications and tutorials in [posts](https://keyue-c.github.io/blog/). Please feel free to reach out using the contact details at the ***bottom*** of the page. I am always happy to discuss research. I look forward to hearing from you!
