Hello! My name is Kayla, or Keyue Chen (陈珂月). I am currently pursuing my fourth year as a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics, within the Division of Psychology and Language Sciences at University College London. I work with [Dr. Wing-Yee Chow](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucjtwyc/Home.html) and [Dr. Andrea Santi](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/34103-andrea-santi/about) on psycholinguistics and sentence processing. 

Currently, my research focuses on (1) how comprehenders generate and update predictions about upcoming language in real-time, and (2) the potential costs of prediction violations. I have used various methods, such as ***reaction time measurements***, ***visual-world eye tracking***, ***mouse tracking***, ***pupillometry***, and ***event-related potentials***, to study these questions. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked briefly as a research assistant at Beijing Normal University under the mentorship of [Dr. Taomei Guo](https://brain.bnu.edu.cn/English/Faculty/CurrentFaculty/Gzz/d7ea1219c8074270bba5c736af040ba7.htm). I completed my undergraduate studies at Nankai University, where I was supervised by [Dr. Quansheng Xia](https://hyxy.nankai.edu.cn/info/1253/2778.htm). 

You can find my [publications](https://keyue-c.github.io/publications/), [conference presentations](https://keyue-c.github.io/conference/), [teaching](https://keyue-c.github.io/teaching/), and [CV](https://keyue-c.github.io/cv/) here. I also share my recent publications and tutorials in [posts](https://keyue-c.github.io/blog/). Don't hesitate to reach out to me through the contact methods you'll find at the ***bottom*** of this page. I'm always happy to talk about research. Looking forward to hearing from you!
